# 2014. Longest Subsequence Repeated k Times

## Description

> You are given a string `s` of length `n`, and an integer `k`. You are tasked to find the **longest subsequence repeated** `k` times in string `s`.
>
> A **subsequence** is a string that can be derived from another string by deleting some or no characters without changing the order of the remaining characters.
>
> A subsequence `seq` is **repeated** `k` times in the string `s` if `seq * k` is a subsequence of `s`, where `seq * k` represents a string constructed by concatenating `seq` `k` times.
>
> - For example, `"bba"` is repeated `2` times in the string `"bababcba"`, because the string `"bbabba"`, constructed by concatenating `"bba"` `2` times, is a subsequence of the string `"**b**a**bab**c**ba**"`.
>
> Return *the **longest subsequence repeated*** `k` *times in string* `s`*. If multiple such subsequences are found, return the **lexicographically largest** one. If there is no such subsequence, return an **empty** string*.
>
>  
>
> **Example 1:**
>
> ![example 1](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2021/08/30/longest-subsequence-repeat-k-times.png)
>
> ```
> Input: s = "letsleetcode", k = 2
> Output: "let"
> Explanation: There are two longest subsequences repeated 2 times: "let" and "ete".
> "let" is the lexicographically largest one.
> ```
>
> **Example 2:**
>
> ```
> Input: s = "bb", k = 2
> Output: "b"
> Explanation: The longest subsequence repeated 2 times is "b".
> ```
>
> **Example 3:**
>
> ```
> Input: s = "ab", k = 2
> Output: ""
> Explanation: There is no subsequence repeated 2 times. Empty string is returned.
> ```
>
> **Example 4:**
>
> ```
> Input: s = "bbabbabbbbabaababab", k = 3
> Output: "bbbb"
> Explanation: The longest subsequence "bbbb" is repeated 3 times in "bbabbabbbbabaababab".
> ```
>
>  
>
> **Constraints:**
>
> - `n == s.length`
> - `2 <= n, k <= 2000`
> - `2 <= n < k * 8`
> - `s` consists of lowercase English letters.

## Solution

```C++
class Solution {
public:
  string longestSubsequenceRepeatedK(string s, int k) {
    dfs("", s, k);
    return best;
  }

private:
  string best = "";

  void dfs(string sub, const string& str, int k) {
    if (!sub.empty() && repeat_count(sub, str) < k) {
      return;
    } else if (sub.length() >= best.length() && sub > best) {
      best = sub;
    }
    for (char c = 'a'; c <= 'z'; ++c) {
      dfs(sub + c, str, k);
    }
  }

  int repeat_count(const string& sub, const string& str) {
    int count = 0;
    for (int i = 0, j = 0; i < str.length(); ++i) {
      if (sub[j] == str[i]) {
        ++j;
        if (j == sub.length()) {
          j = 0;
          ++count;
        }
      }
    }
    return count;
  }
};
```
